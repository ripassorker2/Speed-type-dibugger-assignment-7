                <h6>1. Quistion: What are the different of localstorage and seassion storage ?? </h6>
                <p>The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire,
                    whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets
                    created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a
                    time.</p>

                <h6>2. Quistion: What is global scope and block scope ?? </h6>
                <p> Global Scope:The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program
                    executes by default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not
                    contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript
                    execution environment.
                    <br> Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while
                    loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.

                <h6>3. Quistion: How to work event loop in Java Script ?? </h6>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <h6>4. Quistion: When we get undefined value in Java Script ? </h6>
                <p>We get undefined value -- <br>
                    i.Undefined type is a type whose sole value is the undefined value <br>ii. A declared variable but
                    not yet assigned with a value (uninitialized) is by default undefined. <br>iii. When accessing an
                    object property, sometimes it's necessary to set a default value if the property does not exist.
                    <br>
                    iv. Implicitly, without return statement, a JavaScript function returns undefined. <br>
                    v. We get undefined when accessing an array element with an out of bounds index. <br>
